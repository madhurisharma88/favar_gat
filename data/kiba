Dataset Description: Toward making use of the complementary information captured by the various bioactivity types, including IC50, K(i), and K(d), Tang et al. introduces a model-based integration approach, termed KIBA to generate an integrated drug-target bioactivity matrix.
Task Description: Regression. Given the target amino acid sequence/compound SMILES string, predict their binding affinity.
Dataset Statistics: 0.3.2 Update: 117,657 DTI pairs, 2,068 drugs, 229 proteins. Before: 118,036 DTI pairs, 2,068 drugs, 229 proteins.
