📚 KIBA Dataset Description
The KIBA dataset is a benchmark dataset for evaluating drug–target binding affinity prediction models. It integrates multiple bioactivity measures to provide a unified metric for drug–kinase interactions.

It was introduced in:
"Collaborative filtering approach to the chemical–protein interaction problem"
Tang et al., Bioinformatics, 2014.

🔬 Dataset Summary
Targets: 229 unique kinases (proteins)
Drugs: 2,111 small-molecule compounds
Interactions: ~118,254 drug–target pairs (sparse matrix)
Affinity Score: KIBA score (a unified score combining Ki, Kd, and IC50 data)

✅ Lower KIBA score = higher binding affinity

🧪 Format
The dataset includes:
A drug-target interaction matrix: rows are drugs, columns are targets
KIBA scores as labels (real-valued, continuous)
Optional: SMILES strings for drugs, amino acid sequences for proteins

⚙️ Preprocessing
We use the version of KIBA processed by DeepDTA or GraphDTA:
KIBA scores are normalized or converted to negative values (optional) to align with regression targets (e.g., -KIBA or 1 / KIBA)
Missing interactions are usually ignored

🧠 Applications
The KIBA dataset is widely used in:
Binding affinity regression models
Deep learning (CNN, GNN, Transformer, FAVAR-GAT)
Drug repurposing and virtual screening
