📚 BindingDB Dataset Description
BindingDB is a publicly available database of measured binding affinities, designed to support drug discovery, target identification, and machine learning-based binding prediction. It contains experimental data for interactions between proteins (mainly human drug targets) and small molecule ligands.

🔬 Dataset Summary
Ligands: ~1.5 million small molecules
Targets: ~8,000 proteins (with UniProt IDs)
Interactions: ~2 million compound–protein binding records
Binding Types: Ki, Kd, IC50, EC50, and more
Species: Primarily human, but also includes mouse, rat, etc.
Target Data: UniProt accessions, sequences, target organism
Compound Data: SMILES strings, InChI, PubChem IDs

🧪 Format
The dataset is typically available in:
CSV files with columns such as:
  BindingDB Target Chain Sequence
  Ligand SMILES
  Ki (nM), Kd (nM), IC50 (nM)
  UniProt ID, BindingDB Target Name
  PubChem CID, ChEMBL ID, etc.
Some versions provide 3D structures or SDF files.

⚙️ Preprocessing (in this project)
We use a cleaned version of BindingDB filtered for:
Human proteins only
Valid SMILES and sequences
Affinity types normalized to pKi (−log10(Ki × 1e-9))
Duplicates removed and affinities converted to molar units

🧼 Common preprocessing steps:
Drop missing or inconsistent records
Retain only one affinity type (e.g., Ki) for regression
Remove outliers or non-numeric values

🧠 Applications
BindingDB is used in:
Drug–target interaction prediction (regression/classification)
Training deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, Transformers, GNNs)
Drug repurposing and target prioritization
