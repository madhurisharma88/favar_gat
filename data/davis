📚 Davis Dataset Description
The Davis dataset is a benchmark dataset widely used in drug–target interaction (DTI) modeling and binding affinity prediction tasks. It was originally introduced in the paper:

"Improved prediction of drug–target interactions using regularized least squares with multiple kernels"
Öztürk et al., Bioinformatics, 2013.
https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt593

🔬 Dataset Summary
Targets: 442 kinase proteins
Drugs: 68 small-molecule inhibitors
Data Type: Continuous binding affinities (Kd values in nM)
Size: 68 drugs × 442 targets = 30,056 interactions
Label: The target variable is log(Kd) values (−log10 of dissociation constant in molar units)

🧪 Format
The dataset typically includes:
A drug-target affinity matrix of shape [68 × 442]
Molecular features for drugs (e.g., SMILES, fingerprints)
Protein features (e.g., amino acid sequences or descriptors)

🧠 Applications
The Davis dataset is commonly used for:
Binding affinity prediction using deep learning
Drug repurposing studies
Benchmarking graph-based or sequence-based models

🗂️ Version Used in This Project
We use the processed version of the Davis dataset as made available in the DeepDTA and GraphDTA repositories. Binding affinities are preprocessed to log-scale (pKd = -log10(Kd × 1e-9)).
