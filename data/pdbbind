ðŸ“š PDBbind Dataset Description
The PDBbind dataset is a curated collection of experimentally measured binding affinities for proteinâ€“ligand complexes, derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is widely used in computational drug discovery, especially for:
Structure-based virtual screening
Binding affinity prediction
Deep learning model training and benchmarking

ðŸ§ª Dataset Composition
PDBbind consists of three subsets:
General Set: All proteinâ€“ligand complexes with known 3D structures and binding data.
Refined Set: A subset of the general set with higher quality, filtered based on structural resolution and binding data reliability.
Core Set: A carefully selected benchmark set used for testing, not training.

ðŸ”¬ Features
3D structures of complexes (.pdb files)
Binding affinity data (Kd, Ki, IC50, converted to log-scale)
Molecular descriptors and fingerprints (optional)
Ligand and protein SMILES/InChI (in some versions)
Data spans various protein families and ligand chemotypes

ðŸ“¦ Dataset Format
.mol2, .pdb, .sdf files for ligands and receptors
Affinity data in .csv or .index format
Metadata on resolution, source organism, PDB ID, etc.

ðŸ—‚ Version Used in This Project
We use the PDBbind v2013 Core Set for evaluation and the Refined Set for model training.
