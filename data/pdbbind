📚 PDBbind Dataset Description
The PDBbind dataset is a curated collection of experimentally measured binding affinities for protein–ligand complexes, derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It is widely used in computational drug discovery, especially for:
Structure-based virtual screening
Binding affinity prediction
Deep learning model training and benchmarking

🧪 Dataset Composition
PDBbind consists of three subsets:
General Set: All protein–ligand complexes with known 3D structures and binding data.
Refined Set: A subset of the general set with higher quality, filtered based on structural resolution and binding data reliability.
Core Set: A carefully selected benchmark set used for testing, not training.

🔬 Features
3D structures of complexes (.pdb files)
Binding affinity data (Kd, Ki, IC50, converted to log-scale)
Molecular descriptors and fingerprints (optional)
Ligand and protein SMILES/InChI (in some versions)
Data spans various protein families and ligand chemotypes

📦 Dataset Format
.mol2, .pdb, .sdf files for ligands and receptors
Affinity data in .csv or .index format
Metadata on resolution, source organism, PDB ID, etc.
